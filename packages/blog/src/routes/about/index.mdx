- Food Ordering System

## My Focus on Performance

I firmly believe that the key to business success lies in superior performance. Here are some notable highlights of my contributions in this area:

- Achieved a remarkable **200%** boost in development efficiency by crafting a novel frontend architecture, encompassing rendering, data fetching, state management, folder structure, naming conventions, and more. You can delve into the details in [Frontend Milestones in JunyiAcademy](https://github.com/wtlin1228/blog/blob/master/content/blog/0001-frontend-milestones-in-junyiacademy/index.md).

- Slashed error handling time by nearly **100%** with the implementation of GraphQL Unions and Interfaces. Details can be found in [Improved Error Handling with GraphQL Unions and Interfaces](/posts/graphql-top-pain-point-and-top-benefit/#improved-error-handling-with-graphql-unions-and-interfaces).

- Enhanced critical rendering performance by **250ms** and improved development efficiency by **10%** through an optimized translation workflow. Discover more in [Enhancing UX and DX - The Influence of I18n Workflow](/posts/enhancing-ux-and-dx-the-influence-of-i18n-workflow/).

- Streamlined development efficiency by **10%** with the strategic use of the monorepo tool Nx. Insights are shared in [Scaling Challenges Solved by Monorepo](/posts/scaling-challenges-solved-by-monorepo/).

- Slashed manual labeling time for test IDs by **90%**. Dive deeper into this achievement in [Improve Testing Experience with a11y and i18n](/posts/improve-testing-experience-with-a11y-and-i18n/).

- Developed a CLI tool that reduces the time needed to set up menus for a POS system by **90%**. This tool is invaluable for menu configuration and debugging.

> Software engineering is programming integrated over time.

I firmly believe that a robust engineering culture can yield significant improvements in both product performance and team productivity. To this end, I've taken various steps to emphasize the importance of software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance) within my teams:

- **Technical Decision Reviews**: I led the process of reviewing technical decisions and important frontend topics periodically, utilizing a [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

- **Testing Confidence Boost**: I enhanced testing confidence by migrating from Enzyme to React Testing Library and conducting several internal workshops.

- **Improved Component API**: I introduced a robust component API for our internal UI library, drawing inspiration from insightful talks by [Siddharth Kshetrapal](https://portal.gitnation.org/person/siddharth_kshetrapal).

- **Scalable Documentation**: I made our documentation scalable by leveraging Backstage. Discover the journey in [Scaling Documentation with a Growing Team - Backstage and Docs-like-Code](/posts/scaling-documentation-with-a-growing-team-backstage-and-docs-like-code/).

- **GraphQL Architecture Enhancement**: I spearheaded discussions and improvements in the GraphQL Architecture. Gain insights in [GraphQL - Top Pain Point and Top Benefit](/posts/graphql-top-pain-point-and-top-benefit/) and [AI as GraphQL Gateway](/posts/ai-as-graphql-gateway/).

- **Optimized React Project Structure**: I led the process of migrating to a more scalable React project structure. Explore the details in [React Project Structure for Scale: Decomposition, Layers, and Hierarchy](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-project-structure).

- **TypeScript and Zod Adoption**: I drove the adoption of TypeScript and Zod by conducting internal workshops, utilizing the valuable learning resource from [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/).

My commitment to excellence in engineering is unwavering, and I'm ready to contribute my expertise to elevate your team's performance and drive success. Let's connect and explore how we can achieve greatness together!
